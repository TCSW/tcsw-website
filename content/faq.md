# Junior Interclub

## How does it work?

The junior interclube (JIC) is divided in age categories U18, U15, U12 and U10.
The categories U18, U15 and U12 have two types of ligas. Liga A (Ranking R4-R9) and Liga B (Ranking R7-R9)
The U10 category is the only one where boys and girls can play in the same team.

The teams for each category are drawn into groups of 4 and play at least 3 matches. If the team has performed well enough it will go to the play-offs rounds and play matches until the team loses or become the champions.
The first 3 matches do not have a fixed date, but rather a deadline. The playoff matches are defined by SwissTennis when the publish the JIC details.

Like the normal IC, each team must have a captain, that is responsible for coordinating the matches with the other teams and team members. For the normal IC the captain is one of the players, but for the JIC most of the time, they are a parent of one of the kids in the team.

You can find more information directly on the [SwissTennis](https://www.swisstennis.ch/de/wettkampf/interclub/junioren-interclub/) website

## What are the captains responsabilities and duties?

Because the first 3 matches do not have a fixed date, the captain main responsability is organising with the team members and the other team, a date when they can all play.

The captain is also responsible for entering the matches results after the match is completed.

[Here](/pdf/jic_checkliste_de.pdf) is a captain checklist by SwissTennis.

## When does the matches take places?

The first 3 matches do not have a fixed date, but rather a deadline. The fix date has to be coordinated with the other team's captain.
The JIC tournament starts always after the 4th round of the Normal IC. This is normally begining of June.

## Which tennis ball is used?

The TCSW Junior teams use Babolat Team and Babolat Green balls.
Each team can choose which ball mark to play with, as long as they are allowed by SwissTennis.
